# Stroke Risk Prediction Model and Healthcare Integration

## Problem Background
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 11% of total deaths. Stroke is a serious condition that can result in significant long-term impacts on an individual's quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to be able to predict the potential risk of stroke early on. Predicting the risk of stroke becomes crucial in efforts for prevention and further management to reduce the adverse effects of this disease. In this context, the development of methods or tools for predicting the risk of stroke is a significant concern in the global healthcare community.

## Objectives
Building a classification model to predict the risk of stroke based on risk factors and integrating this model into healthcare management for early identification of stroke risk.

## Demo

## Conclusion
In the context of the stroke prediction business domain, the Decision Tree model offers the advantage of easy interpretation and computational speed. However, its main drawback is data imbalance, which can lead to suboptimal performance in detecting true stroke cases.

## Further Recommendations
- Handling Data Imbalance: To improve the model, it's important to consider data imbalance handling techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using more appropriate evaluation metrics for imbalanced cases.
- Hyperparameter Optimization: The Decision Tree model can be further optimized by searching for better hyperparameters, including tree depth and splitting criteria.
- Consider Other Models: There may be other models more suitable for this dataset, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which can address some of the limitations of the Decision Tree.
- Feature Engineering: Explore relevant features for stroke prediction and perform feature engineering to enhance the quality of model inputs.
- Further Evaluation: In addition to the evaluation metrics already used, consider using other metrics such as Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) or Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) for a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.
- Consultation with Healthcare Professionals: In the development of a stroke prediction model, it's essential to involve healthcare professionals or medical experts to validate model results and understand the clinical impact of the decisions it produces.
